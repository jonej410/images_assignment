// or after you upload it to github at:
//	http://jonej410.github.io/images_assignment/

// put everything inside the pages folder
//================================

//STEP 1: Declare global variables for your images and upload button

function preload(){
	//STEP 2:
	// Load your image with loadImage("path/to/image.jpg")
	//and save it to your global variable:


}

function setup() {
	createCanvas(windowWidth,windowHeight);
	//STEP 3
	//add a file upload button with CreateFileInput(_____);

	//STEP 4:
  //set up your canvas with createCanvas(__,__);

}

function draw() {
ellipse(0,0,50,50);
	//STEP 5:
	//draw your images with image(imagevariable);

	//STEP 7:
	//You're also going to need an if statement here to check
	//if the image the user uploaded exists to then draw it
	//(see image upload example version 2)

}

//STEP 6:
//create a callback function (you can name it anything you'd like)
//which will be called when the user uploads an image:

	//and inside it you will need to save the loaded image to a global variable
